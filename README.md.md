# 🩺 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the **early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy
(DR)** from retinal fundus images using a **Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN)**.
The model classifies images into *five severity levels*:

* 0 → No DR
* 1 → Mild
* 2 → Moderate
* 3 → Severe
* 4 → Proliferative DR

Early detection helps prevent vision loss in diabetic patients.

## 🧠 Dataset

* *Dataset:* APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection
* Due to computational limitations in Google Colab, a **resized subset
(1000 images)** was used.
* Images were resized to *224 × 224* and normalized.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* OpenCV
* NumPy & Pandas
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Streamlit (for web app)
* Ngrok (for public deployment)
* Google Colab

---

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:

* 3 Convolution layers (32, 64, 128 filters)
* MaxPooling layers
* Flatten layer
* Dense layer (128 neurons)
* Dropout (0.5) for overfitting reduction
* Output layer with *Softmax (5 classes)*

*Loss Function:* Categorical Crossentropy
*Optimizer:* Adam

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The model performance was evaluated using:

* Training vs Validation Accuracy Graph
* Training vs Validation Loss Graph
* Confusion Matrix
* Test Accuracy Score

---

## 🌐 Deployment

A *Streamlit web application* was developed for real-time prediction.

Users can:

1. Upload a fundus image
2. Get the predicted DR stage instantly

Ngrok was used to generate a *public URL* for demonstration.
